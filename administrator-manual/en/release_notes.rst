Upgrading rc2 to rc3
--------------------

To upgrade an rc2 installation to rc3, go to the :guilabel:`Software Center` 
page and start the update as usual. 
If the system is running a DPI-enabled kernel, before update
follow :ref:`dpi-kernel_section`.

All bug fixes are applied automatically, but there are some enhancements that
require a manual intervention.

After update run the following command: ::

  signal-event nethserver-sssd-save

If the the web filter is installed, run: ::

  /etc/cron.daily/update-squidguard-blacklists
  signal-event nethserver-squid-update

At the end of updating, a reboot it's recommended
to load the new kernel.

Discontinued packages
---------------------

CentOS 7.3 brings Squid 3.5 which is not compatibile with current
implementation of web antivirus (C-ICAP + Squidclamav),
thus in this release nethserver-squidclamav has been removed.
We are working to find a suitable replacement for the next release.


The following packages were available in the previous 6 release and have been
removed in 7:

* nethserver-collectd-web: replaced by nethserver-cgp
* nethserver-password: integrated inside nethserver-sssd
* nethserver-faxweb2: see the discussion `faxweb2 vs avantfax <http://community.nethserver.org/t/ns-7-faxweb2-vs-avantafax/2645>`_.
* nethserver-fetchmail: replaced by getmail
* nethserver-ocsinventory, nethserver-adagios: due to compatibility problems with Nagios, these modules will be
  mantained only on |product| 6 release
