============================
Accessing the Server Manager
============================

|product| can be configured using the :dfn:`Server Manager` web interface. 
You need a web browser like Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to access the web interface using the address (URL) 
``https://a.b.c.d:980`` or ``https://server_name:980`` where *a.b.c.d* and *server_name* respectively are the server IP address and name 
configured during installation.

If the web server module is installed, you can also access the web interface using this address ``https://server_name/server-manager``.

The Server Manager uses self-signed SSL certificates.
You should explicitly accept them the first time you access the server.
The connection is safe and encrypted.

Login
=====

The login page will gave you a trusted access to the web interface.
Use the user name of **root** and your chosen password when installing |product| to log in.

.. note:: You can change the root password on the web interface by going to the root@domain.com on the upper right and click on Profile.
