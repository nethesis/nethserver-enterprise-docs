Webmail
=======

The default :index:`webmail` client is :index:`Roundcube`.
Roundcube main features are:

* Simple and fast
* Built-in address book integrated with internal LDAP
* Support for HTML messages
* Shared folders support
* Plugins

The webmail is available at the following URLs:

* http://_server_/webmail
* http://_server_/roundcubemail

For example, given a server with IP address *192.168.1.1* and name *mail.mydomain.com*, valid addresses are:

* http://192.168.1.1/webmail
* http://192.168.1.1/roundcubemail
* http://mail.mydomain.com/webmail
* http://mail.mydomain.com/roundcubemail

Plugins
=======

Roundcube supports many plugins already bundled within the installation.

Plugins enabled by default:

* Manage sieve: manage filters for incoming mail
* Mark as junk: mark the selected messages as Junk and move them to the configured Junk folder

Other recommended plugins:

* New mail notifier
* Emoticons
* VCard support


Plugins can be added or removed by editing the comma-separated list inside the ``Plugins`` property.
For example, to enable "mail notification", "mark as junk" and "manage sieve plugins", execute from command line: ::

 config setprop roundcubemail PluginsList managesieve,markasjunk,newmail_notifier
 signal-event nethserver-roundcubemail-update

A list of bundled plugins can be found inside ``/usr/share/roundcubemail/plugins`` directory.
To get the list, just execute: ::

 ls /usr/share/roundcubemail/plugins
